The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza. The pizzeria @ Cosmo was over priced for the quality and lack of personality in the food. Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say...",2011-02-25,2,0

I love their carne asada. They have great lunch specials... Leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant. You have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different And amazing!!!,2012-11-13,5,0
1,LZp4UX5zK3e-c5ZGSeo3kA,3,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g,Terrible. Dry corn bread. Rib tips were all fat and mushy and had no flavor. If you want bbq in this neighborhood go to john mulls roadkill grill. Trust me.,2014-10-23,1,1

Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a ""Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?"" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!",2011-02-25,2,0

They dont serve food unless you order a pizza from a neighboring restaurant. Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was ""busy"" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.",2011-02-25,1,0

Yes, the building is not as fancy as some other places. Yes, i've batted a fly off my plate more than once. Yes, I do NOT go to the bathroom their because I dont even WANT to know what it looks like... 

BUT.. the thai food is the best in town. The service rocks. And you can get a $25 gift cert. on Restaurant.com for $2. Can you beat that? I think NOT.

This is the only place my husband and I go for anniversarys, date nights, birthdays.. anything!! I recommend it to everyone I know. If you KNOW good thai food, go here.",2011-10-10,5,0

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought ""Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know""... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!",2012-04-18,5,0

2 hour wait time= not so amazing, but understandable. 

This place would get 5 stars if they expanded their BBQ restaurant. Their ribs are AMAZING. You get SO much food for the price and it tastes sooo good. Plus, the two hour wait isnt always a bad thing because it gives you an excuse to drink and gamble while you wait!",2011-02-25,4,0
2,LWUtqzNthMM3vpWZIFBlPw,1,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g,"Food is pretty good, not gonna lie. BUT you have to make sacrifices if you choose to eat there. It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area. 

PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great!",2012-11-09,2,1

The items were either bland or stale. My friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt. The biriyani was okayish but bland. Would never recommend to anyone.,2016-09-23,1,0

They take no reservations, so my company of five had to wait outside for about half an hour. I guess it's normal for Saturday night. Unlike my favorite ramen place in NYC you can only order what's on a menu. No deviations or improvisations whatsoever. Our waitress didn't speak much English, and even after writing everything down still managed to make a mistake or two. But, my spicy sesame ramen called Tan Tan was exceptional. I can tell you that. Just the right thickness of broth, and taste - omg.",2017-10-12,5,0

After trying many Mexican restaurants all thru Phoenix & Scottsdale we found an authentic Mexican restaurant that was AMAZING! Fresh tortilla chip & salsa ready and waiting at the table when we sat down. Food was incredible! I ordered the combo with a beef tamale with red sauce & chicken enchilada. Both were full of meat from beginning to end & had so much flavor! Highly recommend this place,2017-08-16,5,0
